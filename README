notes:
For problem 2, because using structs seemed difficult and overkill, not to mention I haven't taken C yet... I stored the result of each test as either S for success or F for fail.

Bonus 1 was done.

The program is called lnfactn.c. 
at n=752, stirling's approximation is within .1% of the real value. This value was attained by running the program on 1000 samples and grepping for .099.

Bonus 2 was done.

The program is called uglyNum.c
% was used to determine if it was ugly.


Bonus 3 was done.

The program is called sigmaDiv.c
% was used to determine divisibility, and summed up.
