directories p1,p2,p3,p4 correspond to their respective problems.
bonus is where the bonus files are.
use make to make all necessary files in each folder.

1.2

The C code was faster because it is a compiled language, and thus after compilation it is direclty read on a machine, not translated line by line by the kernel as with scripting languages.

1.3

The C code was also more accurate than bash with the same sample sizes, which can be attributed to the fact that the random number source was a much better one (using the mersenne twister), whereas the awk one is based on a worse PRNG.

2.
For problem 2, because using structs seemed difficult, I stored the result of each test as either S for success or F for fail.


Bonus.


Bonus 1 was done.

The program is called lnfactn.c. 
at n=752, stirling's approximation is within .1% of the real value. This value was attained by running the program on 1000 samples and grepping for .099.

Bonus 2 was done.

The program is called uglyNum.c
% was used to determine if it was ugly.


Bonus 3 was done.

The program is called sigmaDiv.c
% was used to determine divisibility, and summed up.
